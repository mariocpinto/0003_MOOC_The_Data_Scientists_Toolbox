There is just one assignment to be completed. The assignment is a means to demonstrate that you have RStudio installed, have created a github account, and know how to fork a repository and commit changes. (The related assignment repositores can be found [here](https://github.com/mariocpinto/0004_MISC_datasciencecoursera) and [here](https://github.com/mariocpinto/0005_MISC_datasharing)).

#### Concluding Remarks:
This is a fairly lightweight course and can be completed pretty quickly. The course is primarily aimed to get you primed and set-up for the other courses in the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
